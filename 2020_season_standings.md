# 2020 Season Standings and weekly results

The ABC league includes the following teams and managers:
```
- fastball FC, managed by the fastbal optimizer
- Zidane's Forehead, managed by Robert Sherer
- seagullane, managed by the MLS Fantasy Soccer randomizer
```
For the remainder of the 2020 season, the most recent weekly scores will be
posted here, as well as tables for 1) YTD Total Points and 2) Head-to-Head
points, where 3 points is a win, 1 point a draw, and 0 points for a lost. Since
there are three teams, each team will be in a HtH match with the other team
each week.

**NOTES**

- Week 1
```
- The machine learning model and optimization were completed in time for
week three of the actual fantasy season. So week 1 of the ABC week is
week 3 of the MLS Fantasy Soccer season.
- For week 1 ABC League predictions, a Random Forest model was used.
- For week 2 ABC League predictions, a two-layer neural network was used.
- Week 4 of the MLS Fantasy team/Week 2 of the ABC League season coincided
by the horrible shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, WI. Many MLS teams
boycotted playing in the wake of that shooting, in support of social
justice. As a result, 5 matches were postponed to be played later in the
season.
